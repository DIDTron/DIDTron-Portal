The user is asking about the connexcs-tools npm package. Let me search for information about what this package does and how it could help with our ConnexCS integration.

This is very useful! The connexcs-tools npm package provides several key features that could help us:

SQL Query Execution - Direct CDR database queries
Key-Value Store Operations - For configuration storage
ScriptForge Execution - Run server-side scripts
Environment Variables - Server-side env management
JWT-based Authentication - Better auth handling than what we currently have
Let me explain to the user how this could help.

This is a great find! The connexcs-tools package is an official ConnexCS CLI tool that could significantly improve our integration. Here's how it can help:

Key Benefits for DIDTron
1. Direct SQL/CDR Queries
Instead of using the REST API for CDRs, we can execute SQL queries directly:

cx sql "SELECT * FROM cdr WHERE dt > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 DAY) LIMIT 100"
This gives us much more flexibility for filtering, aggregating, and analyzing call data.

2. Better Authentication
The package uses JWT tokens with automatic 30-day refresh - more secure than storing username/password:

Automatic token renewal when < 15 days remaining
Short-lived access tokens for each request
3. Key-Value Store
We can use ConnexCS's built-in KV store for:

Caching rate cards
Storing customer configurations
Syncing settings between DIDTron and ConnexCS
4. ScriptForge Integration
Run server-side scripts directly on ConnexCS for:

Custom rating logic
Real-time call processing
Automated provisioning
5. Environment Variables
Manage ConnexCS server-side configuration remotely.

Should I Integrate This?
I can replace our current manual API implementation with this official package. It would:

Simplify authentication (JWT instead of Basic Auth)
Add direct SQL access for better CDR queries
Provide KV store for caching
Be more maintainable (official ConnexCS support)
Would you like me to integrate connexcs-tools into DIDTron to replace our current custom ConnexCS API wrapper?

yes do that but create a page for it under settings --> new page name it ( Connexcs status ) inside of it show me the details
