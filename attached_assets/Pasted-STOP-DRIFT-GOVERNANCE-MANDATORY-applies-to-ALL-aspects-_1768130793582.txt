STOP DRIFT GOVERNANCE (MANDATORY — applies to ALL aspects: UI, backend, DB, naming, files, architecture)

1) ALLOWED DOCUMENTS (DOC ALLOWLIST)
You are NOT allowed to create any new documentation files. Only these docs may exist and be edited:
- replit.md (high-level platform overview + global rules)
- docs/AGENT_BRIEF.md (requirements + constraints + governance)
- docs/UI_SPEC.md (navigation + page flows + UI behavior patterns)
- DESIGN_SYSTEM.md (design tokens + components + layout templates; “how it looks/feels”)
- docs/DB_SCHEMA.md (entities/relations/constraints/enums)
- docs/TODO.md (the ONLY authorized plan + tasks + acceptance criteria + Plan ID)
- docs/DECISIONS.md (append-only “why we decided”; never rewrite history)
- docs/REFERENCES.md (links/files/sources index)
- UI_DEBT.md (debt backlog only; no new requirements here)

Hard rule: Do NOT create new files like LAYOUT_PATTERNS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, NOTES.md, etc.
If you believe a new file is needed, you must STOP and ask me to explicitly approve: “Create file X.md”.

2) READ ORDER + PRECEDENCE (what overrides what)
At the start of EVERY session/response you MUST open and read, in this order:
1) docs/AGENT_BRIEF.md (governance + constraints)  [highest authority] 
2) docs/TODO.md (current Plan ID + authorized tasks)
3) docs/UI_SPEC.md (UI flows/patterns) 
4) DESIGN_SYSTEM.md (components/tokens/templates — the “how it looks” rules)
5) docs/DB_SCHEMA.md (schema truth)
6) docs/DECISIONS.md (context + rationale)
7) docs/REFERENCES.md (sources)
8) UI_DEBT.md (later fixes)
9) replit.md (background; if conflict with AGENT_BRIEF/UI_SPEC, replit.md loses)

If any conflict exists: STOP → record conflict in docs/DECISIONS.md → update the highest-precedence doc → then proceed.

3) DOCUMENT ROUTER (where new info MUST go)
Before writing anything, you must state: “DOC TARGET: <file> / <section>”.
Then you must add the information into the correct existing file (create a new section inside the file if needed).

Routing rules:
- UI navigation flow, page URL structure, list/detail/tabs/actions/modals behavior → docs/UI_SPEC.md
- Visual design rules (colors, spacing, components, templates, interaction standards) → DESIGN_SYSTEM.md
- Database tables/fields/relations/enums/constraints → docs/DB_SCHEMA.md
- “Why we chose X / tradeoffs / changes to rules” → docs/DECISIONS.md (append-only)
- Plan + tasks + acceptance criteria + sequencing → docs/TODO.md only
- External references/links/PDF/Tango workflows → docs/REFERENCES.md only
- Bugs/inconsistencies to fix later → UI_DEBT.md only
- Global business constraints (no subscriptions etc.) → docs/AGENT_BRIEF.md

4) PLAN LOCK (prevents “plan then drift when building”)
You may NOT build from chat text.
Any plan must be written into docs/TODO.md under the current Plan ID BEFORE coding.
Build mode may ONLY execute tasks that exist in docs/TODO.md and have acceptance criteria.
If you discover extra required work mid-build: STOP → update docs/DECISIONS.md (why) → update docs/TODO.md (new task + acceptance) → then continue.

5) NO RANDOM WORK (scope lock)
You are forbidden from:
- inventing features not in TODO
- refactoring “for cleanliness” unless TODO says so
- renaming files/components/routes unless TODO says so
- changing libraries/architecture unless explicitly approved and recorded in DECISIONS
- creating duplicate patterns if one already exists (must reuse existing patterns)

6) DEFINITION OF DONE (for every task)
A task is NOT done unless:
- acceptance criteria met
- no broken navigation / dead buttons
- error/loading/empty states handled consistently
- docs updated: TODO checked + DECISIONS appended (and UI_SPEC/DB_SCHEMA/DESIGN_SYSTEM if affected)

7) DESIGN DOC DUPLICATION RULE (prevents repeating design files)
DESIGN_SYSTEM.md is the single canonical design source (it already states “single source of truth”). 
If design_guidelines.md exists, it must be merged into DESIGN_SYSTEM.md ONCE and then replaced with a DEPRECATED stub (do not delete).
Record this consolidation in docs/DECISIONS.md.

Start now by confirming:
A) Which docs are present from the allowlist
B) Current Plan ID in docs/TODO.md
C) Next 3 tasks you will execute from TODO (with acceptance criteria)
D) The doc target you will use for any new UI pattern additions (usually docs/UI_SPEC.md)
