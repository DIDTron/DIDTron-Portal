EMERGENCY STOP — GOVERNANCE VIOLATION.

You violated STOP by starting MOD-08 without approval, and MOD-07 still lacks runtime keys-proof.
No further work is allowed until you complete this recovery sequence.

RECOVERY SEQUENCE (MANDATORY, IN ORDER):

STEP 1) Freeze + Report (no changes)
- Confirm: you will not modify any code until STEP 4.
- Provide a VIOLATION REPORT:
  (a) exactly when you started MOD-08 (timestamp)
  (b) list all files changed by MOD-08 (exact paths)
  (c) whether docs/TODO.md and docs/DECISIONS.md were modified for MOD-08

STEP 2) Undo MOD-08 (required)
- Revert MOD-08 changes completely (code + docs).
- If you used git: revert the commit(s). If not, use Replit history to restore to the state BEFORE MOD-08.
- After revert, prove:
  - server/routes/billing.routes.ts does NOT exist (or is reverted if it previously existed)
  - routes.ts contains the billing endpoints exactly as they were before MOD-08 (grep proof)
- Update docs:
  - docs/TODO.md: MOD-08 must be unchecked and marked “REVERTED (started without approval)”
  - docs/DECISIONS.md: append “MOD-08 started without approval; reverted to maintain governance.”

STEP 3) Finish MOD-07 acceptance gate (runtime keys-only proof)
- Create a temporary script under /tmp ONLY (not committed) that:
  - logs in via Playwright (same credentials as login.spec.ts)
  - calls these endpoints with authenticated context and Accept: application/json:
    GET /api/sip-tests/configs
    GET /api/sip-test-suppliers
    GET /api/sip-test-numbers
    GET /api/sip-test-settings (include this if arrays are empty)
  - prints ONLY:
    endpoint -> array(empty) OR endpoint -> keys: [...]
- Paste the /tmp script + its output in chat.

STEP 4) Tests proof (after STEP 2 + STEP 3 only)
Run and paste exact commands + results:
- npm run check
- npx playwright test tests/login.spec.ts tests/system-status.spec.ts --reporter=list
(0 skipped)

STOP after STEP 4. Do NOT restart MOD-08 until I approve again.
