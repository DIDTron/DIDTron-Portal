That TODO file is really valuable, because it exposes the main problem right now:

Your project isn’t “slow” only because of code — it’s also slow because the plan/log is inconsistent

I can already see multiple TODO hygiene issues that will cause drift and wasted work:

Plan confusion: top says current plan PLAN-2026-01-11-01, but you’re actively working in PLAN-2026-01-13-SYSTEMSTATUS.

Status mismatch: T20 is shown under “Pending Tasks” but is marked [x] ✅ complete.

Performance phase mismatch: Stage 1 tasks T80–T83 are unchecked, but later you have a summary claiming “Stage 1 complete”.

System Status mismatch: you have T125–T144 unchecked (schema/jobs/api/ui), but later you show T145–T151 complete and DB proof exists — meaning earlier tasks may already be done but not checked off (or the plan is outdated).

And the biggest blocker for “production-fast forever”:

npm run check fails with 176 TS errors. Even if “pre-existing”, that blocks a clean release and will keep breaking confidence in every change.

What you should ask the agent to organize (in the right order)
1) Do a “TODO Reconciliation Sprint” (1-time cleanup)

Goal: make docs/TODO.md trustworthy again so the agent stops drifting.

Rules for this sprint:

Do not change product code except what is needed to verify reality.

For each task, either:

mark it ✅ Pre-verified complete (with file paths + evidence), or

keep it pending with clear acceptance criteria.

Outcome: you will have exactly ONE active plan, and everything else archived/closed correctly.

2) Create a separate Plan to fix the TypeScript errors (because npm run check is your gate)

You cannot keep saying “tests fail but not my fault” forever. For production, this must be fixed.

Approach:

Fix by categories:

missing types / incorrect imports

Drizzle types

route handler typing

frontend prop types

Fix in small batches (e.g., 20–30 errors at a time).

Do not refactor architecture while fixing types.

Outcome: npm run check becomes a reliable gate again.

3) Finish the remaining System Status tasks (now that core wiring exists)

From your TODO, the remaining user-facing value is:

T153 storage usage card

T154 API & Errors tab unique content per spec

T155 all slow endpoints/queries cards

T156 active alerts card populated correctly

T157 audit tab real data

Outcome: System Status becomes your real enforcement dashboard.

4) Only after that: Softswitch bounded-context refactor (the big structural work)

Your agent is right that it should be phased, but it must wait until:

System Status shows measured reality

TypeScript gate passes

TODO is clean

Copy/paste this instruction to the Replit AI agent

This is the exact message that will make him organize the project correctly and faster UX-wise without drift:

Follow Bootloader + FOREVER POLICY. No guessing.

NEW PRIORITY: TODO TRUSTWORTHINESS + TS CHECK GATE + System Status finish.
Do NOT start Softswitch refactor until these are done.

1) READ CHECK ✅ with full doc list.

2) TODO RECONCILIATION SPRINT (DOC ONLY FIRST):
DOC TARGET: docs/TODO.md
- Create a new Plan ID: PLAN-2026-01-14-TODO-RECONCILE
- Goal: make TODO consistent and trustworthy.
- Actions:
  a) Identify and fix inconsistencies (examples: tasks marked [x] under “Pending”, Stage summaries claiming complete while tasks unchecked, multiple “Current Plan ID” headers).
  b) For each Plan section, either:
     - mark tasks ✅ Pre-verified complete with file paths/evidence, OR
     - keep them pending with clear acceptance criteria.
  c) Ensure there is ONE active Plan ID at a time and archive old plans as completed.
- Do not change product code in this step unless necessary to verify a claim.

3) TS CHECK GATE PLAN (SEPARATE PLAN):
DOC TARGET: docs/TODO.md
- Create Plan ID: PLAN-2026-01-14-TSCHECK-FIX
- Add tasks to reduce 176 TS errors in small batches (20–30 at a time).
- Acceptance: npm run check eventually PASS. No architecture refactor while fixing types.

4) SYSTEM STATUS FINISH (continue existing plan after TODO cleanup):
Return to PLAN-2026-01-13-SYSTEMSTATUS and complete ONLY remaining tasks:
T153, T154, T155, T156, T157 (one task at a time).
For each task:
- update docs/TODO.md checkoff with file paths
- update docs/DECISIONS.md with what/why
- run Playwright + Axe for System Status
- report results

5) STOP AFTER EACH TASK:
After each completed task, STOP and report:
- Plan ID + task ID checked off
- files changed (high level)
- tests run + pass/fail

No Softswitch refactor until:
- TODO reconciliation is complete
- npm run check is PASS (or a clearly staged plan is underway)
- System Status remaining tasks are complete

Why this will make UX faster (not just cleaner docs)

Because once TODO is accurate + TypeScript check is reliable + System Status is complete, you get:

faster dev iteration (less breakage)

fewer regressions (measurable performance budgets)

faster portal UX because you can target real offenders (API/DB/jobs), not guess based on file size

If you want, paste the agent’s next response after the TODO reconciliation step, and I’ll tell you exactly which System Status task (T153–T157) will give the biggest immediate value first.
