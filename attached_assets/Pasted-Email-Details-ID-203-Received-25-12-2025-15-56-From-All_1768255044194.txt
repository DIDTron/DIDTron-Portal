ALLIP would like to inform you about a new obligation based on the German Telecommunications Law.

The German Telecommunications Law, TeleKommunikations Gesetz (TKG) in its version from 23. June 2021, published in the Federal Law Gazette (Bundesgesetzblatt), Volume 2021, Section I, No. 35, Bonn on 28. June 2021, sets out the following new requirement for German carriers in clause 120, chapter 4:

German Network operators must anonymize all German incoming traffic on interconnection trunks coming from outside of Germany which carry a German A-Number:
 - In this case the P-Asserted-Identity will be suppressed by a &ldquo;Privacy Header&rdquo; and the FROM will be set to &ldquo;anonymous&rdquo;.

Affected by &sect; 120 TKG:
 - Calls with PAI/FROM for 110 and 112, including variations, such as +49, 0049 and NDC (National Dial Code).

This procedure will be implemented starting on 1 December 2022 at the latest.

        Note:
        
        
        A to Z price lists include all of the destinations for every country offered by a Supplier to a Customer.
        FULL COUNTRY price lists don’t contain all of the countries offered by a Supplier, however each country 
         included in the offer has a complete set of destinations. 
        
        
        All of the rates previously provided by the Supplier are replaced by the content of the new price list, 
        and if any destinations are missing in the new price list compared to previous price list, the missing 
        destinations would NOT be considered in effect starting with the price list date.
        
        
        PARTIAL price lists can include multiple destinations belonging to multiple countries, however not all 
        the countries and destinations offered by a Suplier are fully defined. The rates for the missing 
        destinations in the price list are still considered in effect. All of the rates for the missing destinations 
        in the price list are still considered in effect.
