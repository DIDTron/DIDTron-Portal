His reply is not compliant yet, and you should not answer his “Do you want me to…?” question. Under your FOREVER POLICY, he must do it, not ask.

What’s wrong in his reply (quick)

READ CHECK is incomplete: he only read 3 files. He must read the full required list (AGENT_BRIEF, TODO, UI_SPEC, DESIGN_SYSTEM, DB_SCHEMA, DECISIONS + REFERENCES/UI_DEBT if present, and follow your replit.md bootloader).

He claimed “T153–T157 already complete” without showing proof (file paths + endpoint evidence + DB evidence).

He is asking permission instead of writing the plan into TODO and executing the next safe chunk.

Copy/paste this to the Replit AI agent (do not edit)
No questions. Execute policy.

1) READ CHECK — redo properly:
Open and read ALL required docs per the replit.md bootloader (not “referenced in context”):
- docs/AGENT_BRIEF.md
- docs/TODO.md
- docs/UI_SPEC.md
- DESIGN_SYSTEM.md
- docs/DB_SCHEMA.md
- docs/DECISIONS.md
- docs/REFERENCES.md (if exists)
- UI_DEBT.md (if exists)
(+ docs/PERFORMANCE.md ONLY IF the bootloader explicitly requires it)
Then reply with READ CHECK ✅ listing every file you opened.

2) STOP ASKING “Do you want me to…”
Under FOREVER POLICY, you must do REQUEST INTAKE + TODO hygiene automatically.

3) TODO RECONCILIATION SPRINT (do it now):
DOC TARGET: docs/TODO.md
Create/confirm Plan ID: PLAN-2026-01-14-TODO-RECONCILE
Tasks (dedupe first):
A) Fix “Current Plan ID” confusion (only ONE current active plan at the top).
B) Fix checkbox inconsistencies (no task can be under Pending while marked [x]).
C) Fix phase summary mismatches (if Stage 1 claims complete, T80–T83 must be checked with evidence OR summary must be corrected).
D) System Status section: reconcile T125–T157 vs reality with proof.

4) CLAIMS REQUIRE PROOF (no “trust me”):
You claimed T153–T157 are complete. Prove it:
- Provide exact file paths + what changed for each task
- Provide exact endpoints used for each tab
- Provide DB table evidence if applicable
Only then check off each task in docs/TODO.md with completion notes + evidence.

5) TS CHECK FAIL (176 errors):
Do NOT fix TS errors inside TODO reconciliation.
DOC TARGET: docs/TODO.md
Create separate Plan ID: PLAN-2026-01-14-TSCHECK-FIX
Add staged tasks to reduce errors in batches (20–30 at a time) with acceptance: npm run check PASS.

6) Output format (mandatory):
After you update docs/TODO.md, STOP and report:
- READ CHECK ✅ list
- Active Plan ID
- Exactly what you changed in TODO (high level)
- Which tasks you checked off (with proof references)
- What the next SINGLE task is
No coding in this step unless strictly required to verify a claim.

What you should expect after sending this

He should come back with:

a corrected READ CHECK list (including UI_SPEC/DESIGN_SYSTEM/DB_SCHEMA/DECISIONS)

a new Plan ID for TODO reconciliation

a cleaned TODO that’s consistent

proof-backed check-offs (or honest “not done”)

That’s the point where the project becomes easy to manage + faster to improve without drift.
