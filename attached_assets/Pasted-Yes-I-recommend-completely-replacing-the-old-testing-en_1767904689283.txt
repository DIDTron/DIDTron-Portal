Yes, I recommend completely replacing the old testing engine. Here's the final detailed plan:

Final Testing Engine Redesign
What Gets Deleted
Old testModules, testPages, testFeatures, testCases tables (confusing metadata-driven approach)
Old testRuns, testRunResults tables
Old testing-engine-service.ts, testing-engine-repository.ts
Old testing-engine-autodiscover.ts
The confusing UI with checkboxes
New System Architecture
Database (2 simple tables):

e2e_runs:
  - id, name, scope, status, totalTests, passed, failed
  - startedAt, completedAt, duration
  - triggeredBy (super admin who ran it)
e2e_results:
  - id, runId, moduleName, pageName, route
  - status (passed/failed), duration
  - screenshotPath (on failure)
  - accessibilityScore, accessibilityIssues
  - checks (JSON: page loads, content, buttons, forms, accessibility)
UI Design (Super Admin Panel)
Location: /admin/testing-engine
Header Section:

Testing Engine
Comprehensive E2E testing powered by Playwright + axe-core
[Run All Tests]  [Run Selected Module ▼]
Stats Cards (4 cards):

Total Pages	Last Run	Pass Rate	Accessibility Score
70	2 min ago	98%	94/100
Tabs:

Run Tests - Execute new test runs
History - Past runs with drill-down
Live Results - Real-time progress during run
Run Tests Tab
Simple Controls:

Test Scope:  [All Modules ▼]  or  [Select Module: Carriers ▼]
Test Types (all enabled by default):
☑ Page Navigation - Pages load without errors
☑ UI Interactions - Buttons clickable, forms fillable  
☑ API Endpoints - REST calls return expected data
☑ Accessibility - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
[▶ Run Tests]
During Run (Live Progress):

Current: Testing /admin/carriers
✓ Dashboard (1.2s)
✓ POPs (1.8s)  
✓ Voice Tiers (2.1s)

What Each Test Does
1. Page Navigation Test:

Navigate to page
Wait for content to load
Check no JavaScript errors in console
Verify page title exists
2. UI Interaction Test:

Find all buttons → verify clickable
Find all form inputs → verify fillable
Find dropdowns → verify openable
Check for error states
3. API Test:

Call GET endpoint for the page's data
Verify 200 response
Verify response structure matches schema
4. Accessibility Test (axe-core):

Scan page for WCAG violations
Report color contrast issues
Report missing labels
Calculate accessibility score
Auto-Sync with Platform
YES - automatically synced! The system will:

Auto-discover all pages from the sidebar configuration (same 70 pages we already have)

Auto-generate tests for each page based on its type:

List pages → test table renders, pagination works
Form pages → test form fills, validation, submit
Dashboard pages → test cards render, data loads
No manual test case creation needed - it just works out of the box

Summary
Feature	Old System	New System
Test discovery	Manual database entries	Auto from sidebar
Test execution	Fake API mocks	Real Playwright browser
Accessibility	None	Full axe-core WCAG
Screenshots	None	On every failure
Results storage	Complex 6 tables	Simple 2 tables
UI	Confusing checkboxes	Clean single button
Ready to use	Only DID module	All 70 pages immediately
