Let me analyze the Digitalk documentation carefully and explain what I understand:

My Analysis of Import Settings & Business Rules
Import Settings Tab Structure
The Import Settings tab has two sub-tabs:

Import Settings sub-tab (list of carriers with their import configurations)
Business Rules sub-tab (list of reusable business rules)
1. Import Settings List View
Column	Description
Name	Carrier name (clickable link to detail)
Currency	USD, EUR, etc.
Business Rules	Which rule set is assigned (e.g., "+1 Increase")
Carrier Validation	Multi-line showing: From=email, Filename=pattern, Subject=pattern
Auto Import Rules	Count of auto-import rules configured
Notifications	Count of notifications configured
Delete	Delete button
Actions: "Add Import Setting" → Modal with Carrier dropdown + Business Rule dropdown

2. Business Rules List View
Column	Description
Business Rule	Name (clickable link to detail page)
Increase	Days notice required for rate increases
Decrease	Days notice for decreases
New	Days notice for new rates
Deletion	Days notice for deletions
Initial Period	Valid initial billing periods (0,1,6,15,30,60)
Recurring Period	Valid recurring periods
Assigned	"Yes" or "-"
Delete	Delete button
Actions: "Create Business Rule"

3. Business Rule Detail/Edit Page (Two-column layout)
Left Side - Rule Details:

Name (text input)
Assigned: Yes/No
Last Updated: date/time
Business Rules Breach Actions explanation panel:
None: Rule not applied
Alert Only: Identified but can be manually rejected
Reject Rate: Automatically rejected, won't import unless manually accepted
Block Rate: Imported with blocked state
Right Side - Rules and Actions Table:

Rule Type	Rule	Threshold	Unit	Action
Notice Period	Rate Increase	7	Days	Alert Only ▼
Notice Period	Rate Decrease	1	Days	None ▼
Notice Period	New Rate	7	Days	None ▼
Notice Period	Rate Deletion	7	Days	None ▼
Notice Period	Rate Blocked	7	Days	None ▼
Notice Period	Oldest Effective Date	30	Days	None ▼
Notice Period	Maximum Effective Date	30	Days	None ▼
Pricing	Max Increase		%	None ▼
Pricing	Max Decrease		%	None ▼
Pricing	Max Rate			None ▼
Valid Periods	Initial Periods	0,1,60		None ▼
Valid Periods	Recurring Periods	1,60		None ▼
Destination	Code Moved To New Zone			None ▼
Action Dropdown Options: None, Alert Only, Reject Rate, Block Rate

What I Will Build:
Update Import Settings tab with two sub-tabs (Import Settings | Business Rules)
Import Settings list with proper columns and "Add Import Setting" dialog
Business Rules list with proper columns and "Create Business Rule" action
Business Rule detail page with:
Two-column layout (Rule Details left, Rules and Actions right)
Breach Actions explanation panel
Editable threshold inputs and action dropdowns
Save/Cancel/Edit buttons
Should I proceed with this implementation?
