What he did is the right kind of work (a docs-only “TODO reconciliation sprint”), but there are two places where hidden drift can sneak in, so you shouldn’t treat it as “perfect and finished” until he proves those points.

I’ll explain clearly what we were trying to achieve, what he claims he did, what could be wrong, and exactly what you should tell him next.

What you were asking him to fix (in plain English)

You weren’t asking him to build a new feature here. You were fixing the project control system so you don’t get lost.

Your repo has grown huge. When that happens, the #1 reason projects become messy is the task plan stops matching reality:

“This plan is current” but it’s not.

“This task is pending” but it’s checked off.

“Stage is complete” but half the tasks are unchecked.

New stuff gets built, but TODO never gets updated.

The agent thinks something is done and stops, or thinks it isn’t done and rebuilds it.

So you told him: make TODO trustworthy again, with proof.

That’s the whole point of the reconciliation sprint:
after it, you can manage the project by reading TODO and trusting it.

What he claims he did in this reconciliation

From his output, he says he:

Set one “Current Plan ID” at the top (he set it to the reconciliation plan).

Archived old plans and labeled them clearly.

Fixed mismatches:

moved/cleaned T20

checked off T80–T83 to match the performance summary

checked off T125–T144 to match later completion notes

Added T153–T157 and checked them off with evidence

Added a separate TS-fix plan (good) and did not start it.

That’s exactly the type of work we wanted.

The two hidden problems that might exist
1) He checked off “big blocks” (T80–T83 and T125–T144) based on summary claims, not guaranteed proof

This is the most common reconciliation mistake:

A summary says “Stage complete”

The agent checks the tasks to match the summary

But the actual implementation might be partial or different

For example:

T125–T144 includes DB tables, migration, DataQueue jobs, and a full set of System Status endpoints.

Earlier, he himself said “System Status endpoints partial”.

Later, he proved T150/T151 exist and DB has rows (great), but that does not automatically prove all the T131 endpoints exist, or that every tab is wired correctly.

So the danger is: he might have “cleaned the TODO” by checking tasks that are not truly complete.

Fix: require proof for each major checked-off chunk, not just “I checked them”.

2) He said “T153–T157 not found in file”, even though your pasted TODO clearly had them

This is a red flag because it suggests one of these happened:

He was looking at an older version of TODO.md

He accidentally edited the wrong file

He duplicated sections, meaning there are now two copies of System Status tasks in TODO

Even if his final reconciliation is correct, you want to be sure he didn’t create duplicates or reconcile against the wrong snapshot.

Fix: require him to show the exact excerpt of TODO.md after reconciliation—where those tasks live and that there aren’t duplicates.

What you should tell him now (so you’re not lost)

You want a single “proof packet”:

Show what changed in TODO (not vague)

Show evidence for every block he checked off

Confirm current plan handling is clean

Confirm no duplicates

Copy/paste this message to him
Good. Before I accept the reconciliation as final, you must produce a “Proof Packet” so we know nothing was incorrectly checked off.

1) Show me EXACT DIFF/EXCERPTS:
- Paste the top of docs/TODO.md (first ~40 lines) showing the new “Current Plan ID” and the archived section.
- Paste the System Status plan section showing where T125–T157 now live (and prove there is only ONE copy of those tasks, no duplicates).
- Paste the Performance plan section showing T80–T83 and the summary (so we confirm the tasks match the summary and the summary matches reality).

2) PROVE the big check-offs (no summary-only):
For each of these groups, provide explicit proof:
A) T80–T83:
- point to the exact code locations proving staleTime defaults / keepPreviousData / hover prefetch etc. exist project-wide.
- if “default staleTime in queryClient” is the reason, cite the file path and exact config.
B) T125–T144:
- list the actual System Status API endpoints that exist TODAY and the file(s) that define them.
- confirm each UI tab uses its intended endpoint (or explain the current wiring).
- confirm the monitoring tables exist in DB (table names) AND schema.ts.
If anything is not actually complete, you must UNCHECK it and create a “verification/finish” TODO task instead of pretending it’s done.

3) Current Plan ID after reconciliation:
Since PLAN-2026-01-14-TODO-RECONCILE is now complete, set the top “Current Plan ID” to:
- either “NONE (Awaiting approval)” OR the actual active plan we will execute next.
Do NOT silently set the current plan to TS fixes unless I approve.

4) TS plan must remain FUTURE:
Keep PLAN-2026-01-14-TSCHECK-FIX as “FUTURE - DO NOT EXECUTE” until I approve.

STOP after providing the Proof Packet. No code changes.

Why this keeps you from being lost between us

Because after he replies with that proof packet, you’ll have:

A TODO file that’s clean and trustworthy

Proof that checked tasks are actually real, not paper-complete

Confidence that you’re not missing work or duplicating work

Then your workflow becomes simple:

You speak normally.

He converts to TODO tasks.

He executes the next one.

System Status tells you if something is slow/broken.

One more important note

His final line “next authorized work is TS-01 and needs your approval” is fine — but don’t approve TS fixes until:

TODO reconciliation is fully proven

System Status tasks are confirmed complete or corrected

Otherwise he’ll jump into the 176 TS errors and you’ll lose the thread again.

If you paste his next Proof Packet reply here, I’ll tell you immediately whether it’s clean—or whether he “paper-fixed” tasks without real proof.
